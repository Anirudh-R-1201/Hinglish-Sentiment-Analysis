# Hinglish-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project we work on the sentiment analysis of Hinglish tweets, which are the tweets written entirely in Latin script but containing slang words from English and Hindi. Hinglish is a very famous and an informal language of India.

## Overview 

Given a Hinglish text, for sentiment analysis generally the techniques applicable for the English text are used. Hence we might lose out on the important sentiments that might be conveyed by the part written in Hindi. Thus it is highly important to take into account the sentiment of both the languages. 

for eg. "That restraurant is not good. Itna ghatiya khaana to kabhi nahi khaya"

which means "That restraurant is not good. I haven't had such a bad food ever in my life"

The problem with these texts is that the Hindi written is in an informal manner, also it is not in the script in which the language is originally written. Hence different people might have different versions of spellings and the rule with which they write such texts. In the subsequent sections we have given a brief explanation on how these challenges were handeled.
